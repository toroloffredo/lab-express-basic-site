            <h1>BB KING</h1>
            <div>
                    <p>Riley B. King (September 16, 1925 â€“ May 14, 2015), known professionally as B.B. King, was an American blues
                        singer-songwriter, guitarist, and record producer. He introduced a sophisticated style of soloing based on fluid
                        string bending, shimmering vibrato, and staccato picking that influenced many later blues electric guitar
                        players.

                        <br>
                        AllMusic recognized King as "the single most important electric guitarist of the last half of the 20th
                        century".

                        King was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and is one of the most influential blues musicians
                        of all time, earning the nickname "The King of the Blues", and is considered one of the "Three Kings of the Blues
                        Guitar" (along with Albert King and Freddie King, none of whom are related). King performed tirelessly throughout 
                        his musical career, appearing on average at more than 200 concerts per year into his 70s.[10] In 1956 alone, he
                        appeared at 342 shows.

                        King was born on a cotton plantation of Berclair near the city of Itta Bena, Mississippi, and later worked at a
                        cotton gin in Indianola, Mississippi. He was attracted to music and taught himself to play guitar and began his career
                        in juke joints and local radio. He later lived in Memphis and Chicago; then, as his fame grew, he toured the world
                        extensively.
